The init command helps getting started with elm-review’s configuration.

    elm-review init
        It will ask permission to create several files:
        - review/elm.json in which you may add dependencies with review rules.
        - review/src/ReviewConfig.elm to define your configuration.

        After the files have been created, it will provide links to get you
        started.

You can customize the init command with the following flags:

    --config <path-to-review-directory>
        Create the configuration files in the specified directory instead of in
        the review/ directory.

    --compiler <path-to-elm>
        Specify the path to the elm compiler.
        The elm compiler is used to know the version of the compiler to write
        down in the review/elm.json file’s `elm-version` field. Use this if you
        have multiple versions of the elm compiler on your device.
